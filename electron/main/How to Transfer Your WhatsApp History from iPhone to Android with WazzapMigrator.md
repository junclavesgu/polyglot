# How to Transfer Your WhatsApp History from iPhone to Android with WazzapMigrator
 
If you have recently switched from iPhone to Android, you might be wondering how to transfer your WhatsApp history to your new device. WhatsApp does not offer a native way to do this, as it uses iCloud for iPhone backups and Google Drive for Android backups. However, there is a third-party app that can help you with this task: WazzapMigrator.

In this article, we will show you how to use WazzapMigrator to migrate your WhatsApp history from iPhone to Android in a few simple steps.
 
## Step 1: Extract Your iPhone WhatsApp Backup
 
The first step is to extract your iPhone WhatsApp backup from your iTunes backup. You will need a PC or Mac with iTunes installed and a USB cable to connect your iPhone. Follow these steps:
 
- Connect your iPhone to your computer and launch iTunes.
- Select your iPhone from the device list and click on the Summary tab.
- Under Backups, click on Back Up Now and wait for the backup process to complete.
- Download and install iBackup Viewer from [https://www.imactools.com/iphonebackupviewer/](https://www.imactools.com/iphonebackupviewer/).
- Launch iBackup Viewer and select the backup you just created.
- Click on the Raw Files tab and navigate to AppDomainGroup-group.net.whatsapp.WhatsApp.shared/ChatStorage.sqlite.
- Right-click on ChatStorage.sqlite and choose Export File. Save it to a folder on your computer.
- Navigate to MediaDomain/Library/Media/WhatsApp and right-click on WhatsApp folder. Choose Export Folder and save it to the same folder as ChatStorage.sqlite.

You have now extracted your iPhone WhatsApp backup. You will need these two files (ChatStorage.sqlite and WhatsApp folder) for the next step.
 
## Step 2: Transfer Your iPhone WhatsApp Backup to Your Android Device
 
The next step is to transfer your iPhone WhatsApp backup to your Android device. You will need a USB cable to connect your Android device to your computer. Follow these steps:

- Connect your Android device to your computer and enable USB debugging mode. You can find instructions on how to do this for different devices [here](https://www.wazzapmigrator.com/faq/how-enable-usb-debugging-mode).
- Download and install WazzapMigrator from [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nbeghin.whatsappmigrator). It is a paid app, but it offers a money-back guarantee if you are not satisfied with the results.
- Launch WazzapMigrator on your Android device and grant it the necessary permissions.
- Tap on Select iPhone Archive and choose ChatStorage.sqlite from the folder where you saved it.
- Tap on Select Media Folder and choose WhatsApp folder from the same folder where you saved it.
